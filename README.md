# Leetcode Solutions in JavaScript

This repository contains my solutions to various Leetcode problems solved using JavaScript. Each problem has its own file named after the problem's title with a corresponding number.

## Why this Repository?

This repository is created to track and maintain all the Leetcode problems that I solve as a part of my practice. This will also help me keep a record of the solutions and help me to revise them later if needed.

## How to use this Repository?

The corresponding solution of each problem is stored in its respective file. The problem statement is added as comments on top of every file for easy reference. To run or test the solution, copy the solution code and paste it into the Leetcode editor. After pasting the code, simply click on the "Run Code" button to see the output.
